Do with this file as you please. 

This code calculates a value for Pi (3.14..) by bouncing blocks together against a solid barrier. 

See links below for an explianation of why this works.

Initial values for velocity, mass etc. were chosen as per information below and it worked first time !

I developed this on MacBook Air M3 .. since it uses the pymunk physics engine, your result may vary depending on CPU/GPU, processing speed etc. but it should work.
